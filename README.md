PhiLand
Description
In the kingdom of Phi-land, the king challenges his students with a mysterious task.

## Statement
In the mystical land of Phi, there lived legendary coders. One day, the king of Phi-land, intrigued by this coder’s abilities, devised a challenge to test the wit of his students.

The king declared, "I will give a string, "Phitron". Your task is to transform it and present it back to me in a manner such as "nortihp". I won’t reveal the exact steps, but only the sharpest mind will understand my intention."

The king handed over the string and left, confident that only one student would be clever enough to unravel the true requirement.

The student is YOU! Now, it’s your turn to rise to the challenge and demonstrate your mastery to the king. The king will give you a string, and your task is to transform it and present it exactly as the king desires. Only the cleverest will succeed — will you be the one to impress the king?

Hints: Investigate the sample test cases carefully!
